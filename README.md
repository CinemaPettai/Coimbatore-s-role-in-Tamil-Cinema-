Be it Tamil Cinema production, movie news, latest movie equipments, hospitality to <a href="http://www.cinemapettai.com/category/actors-photos">Tamil Actors Photos</a> and <a href="http://www.cinemapettai.com/category/actress-stills">Tamil Actress Stills</a> Coimbatore has set a bench mark to Tamil movie industry.  

Few visionary of Tamil cinema rather we can say south Indian cinema are Mr. Samikannu Vincent, Mr.T.R.Sudram and Mr.S.M.Sriramulu Naidu. 

Samikannu was working in South Indian Railway as a draftsman-clerk. He watched few short films which were exhibited by a French Film exhibitor Dupont, he also fallen ill on his touring exhibition. After few months when Dupont wanted to return to France, Samikannu somehow raised money and bought the projector. He used to travel to nearby villages to exhibit the short films. 

This business become very profitable to Samikkanu so re resigned the job from south Indian Railway and started taking the mobile cinema tent theatre to nearby towns and Madras. Since we got good response for the motion pictures exhibition he started travelling to Singapore and Malaysia. From 1905 to 1914 he did this business of brick and mortar cinema house and in 1914 he built south India’s first permanent cinema Theatre at Town Hall in Coimbatore. He named it as Variety Hall cinemas (now Delite Talkies). Now the road is called as Variety Hall road in Coimbatore. 

By 1919, he established the first power-driven Rice and Flour Mill in Coimbatore. He managed all this by working throughout the day; later his sons came to help him in his business. Apart from cinema hall he set upped an electric power house to supply electricity for his theatre. With the assistance from member of Governor's Executive Council in charge of the Electricity portfolio Sir C.P.Ramaswamy Ayer from 1922 he supplied electricity to Stanes European High School, Street lights and few buildings in Coimbatore city. 

He expanded his business from cinema theatre to electricity power house and later he realized he needs to promote the cinemas and his cinema exhibitions so he started a printing press and named it as Electric Printing Works to print handbills and distribute it to the nearby localities and villages. 

He also became a distributor for the French Pathé Frères movie projectors. 

In the meanwhile during the late 1920s, another firm under Sabapathy was involved in the distributorship of an Italian movie projector company, eventually leading to the manufacture of their own brand of movie projectors in Coimbatore. By the early thirties Sabapathy started a studio named Premier Cinetone Studio (later renamed Pakshiraja Studios). 

In the cinema exhibition business Samikannu got good profits he started to producing motion pictures.. In the early 1930s he launched the Variety Hall Talkies banner to make sound film (talkie movies) and joined hands with pioneer film company, Calcutta in the year 1933. Samikannu co-produced "Valli Thirumanam”, Sampoorna Harichandra" and "Subhadra Parinayam" along with pioneer film company. Which were mainly shot in Calcutta. 

Feeling a need to have a movie studio, he was instrumental, along with other industrialists B. Rangaswamy Naidu, Sriramulu Naidu, G.Kuppuswamy Naidu(Lakshmi Mills), R. K. Ramakrishnan Chettiar established a fully equipped studio in Coimbatore. Thus born the central studios. Studio commenced its operation in 1936 with their first release being Thukkaram in 1937 directed by S. M. Sriramulu Naidu. By the early 1940s the Studio became the central hub of South Indian Movie industry. Studio produced Telegu Movies, Malayalam movies and Hindi Movies. 

In the early 1930s, T. R. Sundaram a London educated graduate entered the world of Tamil cinema as a partner of a Salem-based film company, Angel Films. He was involved in productions such as Draupadi Vastrapaharanam (1934), Dhruva (1935) and Nalla Thangal (1935). With the differences of opinion he came out and started his own studio “Modern Theatres” in Salem. 
	
Samikannu Vincent died in 1942, after his death and difference of opinion with the partners S. M. Sriramulu Naidu left Central Studios and took over the Premier Cinetone Studio in 1945. Studio located in Puliyakulam Road, Red Fields, Coimbatore. He further constructed new floors and infrastructure and made it a full-fledged Movie Studio with in-house processing labs. He renamed the studio as Pakshiraja Studios. Today Samikannu Vincent’s birthday is celebrated as Cinema theater day.

With three major studios Central studio, Pakshiraja Studios and Modern Theatres in Kongu naadu region (Coimbatore and Salem) become hub of movie productions in south India beating Madras (Chennai). 

More than hundred films that came from Modern Theatres covered a wide spectrum of themes — mythology, comedy and original screenplays to adaptation of classic works of literature and murder mysteries. It is, however, the James Bond style of films starring Jaishankar that are almost synonymous with the banner. 

Following the Hollywood style of making and managing studios, T.R.Sundaram had his employees in company rolls, writers, technicians, actors and so on. He paid generously and promptly, a rarity in the film circle.

The most popular hits to come from Pakshiraja studio was M. G. R and Banumathi starrer Malaikkallan in 1955 and the Dilip Kumar, Meena Kumari hit Azaad, which was the highest grosser in Bollywood for that year. Also this movie was the first for Dilip Kumar and Meena Kumari in lighter roles as against their tragic roles in most other movies. Malaikkallan was M. G. R's first major box office hit.
